# VRND_Puzzler_AbdullahMH

# Introduction
As a part of VR development Nano-degree in Udacity, I have create a document that describe puzzler project and this document contains five sections: outcomes, story of the process, user testing outcomes and iteration, sketching and conclusion. I think the future will be in the virual reality so I most start now learn unity and vr development. First I buy Google cardboard and now I have laptop that is VR ready (MSI) and very soon I will buy HTC Vive!.

**Why did you build this project?**
This project is so important for the costumers who will use VR. It test how the people see VR and if it is okay for them they will start playing VR games!. We need in the beginning simple game that show how VR works. 

**How long did it take to build?**
This project should not take more than 3 weeks, I did it in 2 weeks!.

**What is unique about your game?**
The puzzle because it comes randomly each time.

# User testing outcomes and iteration
I have test the project step by step with my friend Abdulaziz which he is a software developer but no experience with the VR, so he is good choice to test. 


About the UI ?
Abdulaziz: It is good but the quality is low.
Me: I make the text "overflow".

About Environment?
Abdulaziz: I feel I am so small or the things are big!
Me: change the scale to be more fit.

Any ideas or feedback?
Abdulaziz: This is good start for you! I think you need bigger environment and active. !
Me: add sound and plane with red black plane.

Is the goal clear? 
Abdulaziz: Yes, it is classic puzzle!

1. The user click on "start"                  
2. The user will go to the puzzle room 
3. The user see the puzzle in front of him
4. The user will solve the puzzle
5. The user will go to "restart UI"

# Tools 

1. Unity 2017.0
2. Google VR 1.6
3. iTween 

# Conclusion
Now I can say I can build a vr game with no motion sickness. It took me about 2 weeks because the difference between videos and current Google vr sdk and I had faced many issues like audio listener ( should contains pointer physical raycaster) that was the main issue. 
Also with the event system its not work properly with GVR 1.7 (1.6 is good for Android).
